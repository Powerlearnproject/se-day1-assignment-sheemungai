Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Answer:
software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing and maintaining a software.
It provides a foundation in developing efficient and secure software systems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Answer:
AI assistants-AI powerered coding assistants have emerged such as Github Copilot
software development tools- to improve productivity tools such as IDEs have emerged
DevOps movement- it started bridging the gap between development and operations

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Answer:
1.Planning- involves defining the software's purpose, scope and risks
2.Requirement gathering- involves identifying user needs and system requirements
3.Design- creating software architecture, database and designs
4.Coding- implementing the actual code
5.Testing- identifying errors and bugs through various tests and fixing them
6.Deployment- releasing the system to the user and examining if its proper functioning
7.Maintenance- providing updates and improving efficiency after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Answer:
Waterfall methodology is sequential where it follows predefined phases and changes are difficult to implement once a phace is done while the agile methodology is iterative where it works in phases/cycles called sprints and is highly flexible as changes can be done at any point.
waterfall scenario- banking system
agile scenario- e-commerce website

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer- writing code,design, testing and deployment of software applications
Quality Asssurance Engineer- works closely with the software developers to ensure that the software meets the quality standards and functionality.
Project Manager- oversees the project plan, execution and completion to ensure the project meets the deadline and budget.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Answer:
IDEs- improves productivity with features such as debbuging tools and provides build-in compiler to easily execute code. eg Eclipse
VCS -Helps developers to manage and track their code from timee to time and also enables multiple programmers to colaborate while working on the same project. eg Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Answer:
Security vulnerablities such as hacking. Strategy- educating developers on the security measures to undertake to ensure securit on their machines and activities
Rapid technology changes such as new frameworks. Strategy- listening to podcasts, reading tech articles and following tech groups/platforms on social media.
Debbuging complex codes- using the available debbuging tools

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing- involves testing individual fuctins and methodsof the classes used by the software
Intergration testing- test is done on different modules that are used by the application to ensure that they are working correctly
System testing- test done on the entire system to ensure its fully functioning and meeets the required specifications
Acceptance test-test whether the system meets the business and user requirements and if its ready for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering- is a way of giving clear and specific commands to AI
importance- it enables the AI to understand the commands and give clear direct answers as required

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
example:how was your day? 
improved:Tell me about the most intersting part of your day.
the first prompt is general as it just gives just a summary of the day without much detail but the second prompt is most specific to the intersting part of that day thus the response will be clear.
